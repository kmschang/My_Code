# My_Code

## Python
- Started learning around 2018
- Progess has been slowed as my focus right now is on Java and Swift

### Notable Projects

#### TicTacToe.py
- First ever big project in pyton
- Started it about 4 years ago
- Didn't know about loops so mostly hard coded
- Used as the basis for my java version

#### Blackjack.py
- following a class online and made this program together
- uses classes and functions which were new to me at the point
- has some loops which I learned make code so much easier

#### Function Library
- files that have functions that I have contributed over time
- Can import that into any file and use those functions

#### Games
- Simple games that I have made over the years
- Not super complicated but each focus on a different aspect of coding

#### Other .py Files
- simple programs I programmed while I was learning python
- many have different versions each with different feature and different way to use them

## Other

- hooks, scripts, and workflow are all present here
- Run these programs before commiting to make sure the files will compile and are formatting correctly
